# Exercise D: Writing your own function

Before starting this exercise you should work through

* First part of *Chapter 3 Logic, Control Flow and Filtering* 
  stopping before the video "Filtering Pandas DataFrame",
* First part of  *Chapter 4 Loops*
  stopping before the video "Looping Data Structures, part 1",

from the
[DataCamp online course: Intermediate Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science),
.
We will then use what you have learnt there to explore how biological 
data can be handled in Python. 

To use this exercise you should either:

* Import the exercise as a library into your Azure Notebooks account,
  by clicking on: 

  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-C/)

  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using Azure Notebooks
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-azure-notebooks).

* or if you are using a local Jupyter Notebook installation, then 
  download:

  [<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-C/archive/master.zip)

  then unzip the file and move the directory to where you are storing your work.
  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-local-jupyter-notebook-installation).

Then in Azure Notebooks or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the workbook **ex_C_workbook.ipynb** and work through it.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **ex_C_homework.ipynb**
* we will go through everyones completed notebook in [Seminar C](https://canvas.anglia.ac.uk/courses/1490/discussion_topics/54062?module_item_id=277993).
